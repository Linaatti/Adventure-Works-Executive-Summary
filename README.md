KPI Overview:
Total Sales (Sum of Order Total by Order Date): $6.8K
This KPI shows the total sales revenue, which is important for tracking overall performance.

Count of Cities: 14
This tells you that sales are spread across 14 cities, giving an indication of geographical reach.

Average Order Total by Order Date: $3.4K
The average order value suggests the typical size of transactions, which can be used to gauge customer spending behavior.

The bar chart shows sales performance by product category:

Mountain Bikes are the top-performing category with $64K in sales.

Road Bikes follow with $52K, and Touring Bikes with $35K.

Categories like Kids Bikes and BMX Bikes perform significantly lower, with only $1K and $2K respectively.

This insight can help the business focus marketing efforts on high-performing categories while considering strategies to boost sales in lower-performing ones.

The line chart visualizes sales over a period of time (by day). You can observe fluctuations in sales:

There are noticeable peaks and troughs throughout the month.
The highest peak occurs around day 20, indicating a surge in sales on that specific day, while some days experience much lower activity.

The table provides detailed information on individual products:

You can see which products have the highest order totals, the number of orders, and their statuses (e.g., "Processing," "Shipped," "Cancelled").
This can help identify which products are in high demand and whether there are any fulfillment or operational issues.

The Q&A section suggests questions you can ask for further analysis

Key Insights & Recommendations:

Top-Selling Products: 
Mountain Bikes are leading the sales, so the company should focus on stocking and promoting this category.

Underperforming Products:
Kids Bikes and BMX Bikes have very low sales; reevaluate the strategy for these productsâ€”whether to promote more or consider discontinuing.

Sales Peaks: 
There are noticeable spikes in sales on specific days, possibly due to promotions or events. Replicating successful strategies from these days could help boost sales in future periods.

Forecasting: 
The forecast shows a potential dip in future sales, which calls for preventive actions such as running promotions or advertising to keep the momentum going.

Order Status: 
Some orders, like Adventurer 1000, are still in processing, indicating room for improvement in order fulfillment and logistics.
